**Welcome** to the draft for **My Rival/II-Mio-Rivale**!

The idea is to create an application that would allow similar people to connect with each other and engage in a healthy, kind of, one-on-one competition.

What we are proposing here is introducing a variant of buddy system, used in the army, that will focus on pushing you & your accomplice to do better. 

Years of research has noted that people tend to improve at a fast rate when competing with someone. 

Sometimes, after watching some motivational content we resolve ourselves to work and often get a lot of things done rather quickly. However the problem arises when the motivational feeling fades off. After a couple productive days, we tend to revert back to our old selves, refusing to commit to the work like we were doing moments ago.

So how to we maintain this motivational feeling for an extended period of time?

The answer is....**we can't**.

It's impossible to stay motivated for an extended period of time, it simply isn't realistic to think that we can keep ourselves motivated for more a week, at most. Humans are programmed in a certain way that makes it easier to lose focus, we an innately curious creatures and are constantly searching for more content, variety, to consume.

So what's the solution then?

Well, peer-pressure is a great, constant, motivator.

The feeling of urgency, haste, fear of being left in the dust, forces us to work and stay focused. Especially for students, when your classmate has completed the entire chemistry syllabus, a sudden unsettling feeling grabs hold of you, telling you to catch up with your classmate.

This restlessness forces us to study and try to close the gap between yourself and your classmate.

**The same concept can be applied to studies or general life, we set goals and compare ourselves with someone who has a similar agendas, while simultaneously trying to better ourselves, better than the other person.**

Hence we enter a pseudo-paradox where two individuals push each other to improve and best the other person.

Of course there are lot many variables that may affect the progress on the two individuals, resulting in one of them soundly leaving the other in dust. However what if we somehow manage to eliminate most of these variables?

What if we are able to create a proper pseudo-paradox, with a proper end-goal **(exit-condition)**?

1. **Step-1:**

We aim to make an application that would pair two individuals, on the basis of their similarities and goals **(this data can be collected before hand through a comprehensive questionnaire)**. 

2. **Step-2:**

We can then ask the individuals to set certain goals, time-table, dates, tasks, etc. through mutual agreement **(can be done through an in-build voting system)**.

3. **Step-3**

Once they have identified their goals, we can they start a race. Imagine all their goals lay on a progress bar and as you accomplish a certain task, the progress bar moves forward, on to the next goal while the same thing happens with the other individual.

A **race** is taking place between the two individuals, to see who can reach the finish line first! 

**(The completion of a goal must be cross-checked by the other person within a certain, agreed upon, time period with enough proof to move forward on the progress bar. The person cross-checking must also provide enough proof, in case they rejects the completion of the goal, by the other person.)**

**(In case the either of the individuals try to sabotage the other, through unjustly rejecting the completion of a goal, done by the other person or knowingly dragging the cross-checking process in order to gain more time, the guilty will be ejected from the race and given a 5-day ban.)**

**(Cases of disputes, regarding anything will be handled by a none-partial, third person, a staff member.)**

There are lot more things that are to be added to this idea, in order to make this project into a reality, however this draft contains an overview on what we are aiming to achieve. More detailed documentation will be added as we explore the idea.

Thanks You For Reading!
